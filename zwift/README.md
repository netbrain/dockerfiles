# Zwift

Hello fellow zwifters, here is a docker image for running zwift on linux. It uses the companion app by zwift for linking up smart trainers and other bluetooth/ant devices. The reason why I made this solution was so i could run multiple zwift instances on one machine at the same time. It does however require a nvidia graphics card, feel free to contribute for other systems.

If you find this image useful, then feel free add [me](https://www.zwift.com/eu/athlete/4e3c5880-1edd-4c5d-a1b8-0974ce3874f0) and give me a ride on from time to time.

## Prerequisites

- [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
- Allow container to access the x-host by issuing the command `xhost +` (this will however allow everyone to your X server which is considere unsafe, if this is a concern of yours, then `man xhost`)

## Quickstart guide

Make sure nvidia-container-toolkit is installed and working.

```
xhost +
docker pull netbrain/zwift:latest
docker run --gpus all \
 --privileged \
 --rm \
 -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
 -v /run/user/$UID/pulse:/run/user/1000/pulse \
netbrain/zwift:latest
```

Please note that the above command does not mount a volume to persist configuration files. 
If you wan't a proper setup then take a look at zwift.sh

## How can I build the image myself?

```
docker build -t netbrain/zwift .
docker run --gpus all \
 --privileged \
 --name zwift \
 -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
netbrain/zwift
```

After install and update is complete stop the container `docker stop zwift` and proceed with comitting a new version.

```
export ZWIFT_VERSION=1.20.0			  	# Or whatever the latest version is
docker commit zwift netbrain/zwift:$ZWIFT_VERSION 	# Create a new image with the latest update
docker rm zwift 					# Remove the no longer needed container
```

## How can I fetch the image from docker hub?

https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/netbrain/zwift

```
docker pull netbrain/zwift:$ZWIFT_VERSION # or simply latest
```

## How can I run Zwift?

I would suggest taking a look at zwift.sh, but in essence the following is executed:

```
docker run --gpus all \
 --privileged \
 --rm \
 -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
 -v /run/user/$UID/pulse:/run/user/1000/pulse \ 
 -v $HOME/.zwift:/home/user/Zwift \
netbrain/zwift:$ZWIFT_VERSION # or "latest"
```


## How can I update Zwift?

Zwift does not update on it's own. So in order to keep zwift up to date you can simply pull netbrain/zwift:latest from time to time, I will try to keep up with the updates. However if I fail at this task then see the following instructions.

```
docker run --gpus all \
 --privileged \
 --name zwift \
 -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
netbrain/zwift:latest update

export ZWIFT_VERSION=1.20.0 #increment this 
docker commit zwift netbrain/zwift:$ZWIFT_VERSION
docker tag netbrain/zwift:$ZWIFT_VERSION netbrain/zwift:latest
docker push netbrain/zwift:$ZWIFT_VERSION
docker push netbrain/zwift:latest
```

## Contibute

Would be nice to supply docker containers for other environments than nvidia gpu's. As I don't have a machine myself with intel or amd gpu's I require other to test and manage these images.

If you would like to contribute, then please by all means ill accept PR's. A good starting point would be http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/Hardware%20Acceleration
